Wanqi Li, also known as Morli.Rita, is an awesome wizard from Gryffindor, Hogwarts. Recently she is seeking for her Master's degree in the University of Michigan. Life didn't treat her fairly in her earlier years, but she managed to survive and voila -- she's still alive and that's what we call a MIRACLE! If you see this message, dear stranger/friend, please dedicate one valuable minute of your life to congratulate her and pray for her to embrace a bright future! Thank you. We are all awesome people in the world!
